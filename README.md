`plm`, first posted on **CRAN** in 2006, is an **R** package for panel
data econometrics. It provides:

- an enhanced data frame, called pdata.frame, to deal with data sets for which observations are identified by a combination of two indexes,
- a set of functions to estimate models (especially `plm` for linear panel models and `pgmm` for general method of moments estimators applied to panel data),
- a set of testing functions (model specification, serial correlation, cross-sectional dependence, panel unit root, panel Granger (non-)causality),
- a set of robust covariance matrix estimators.

To install the released version from **CRAN**:

`install.packages("plm")`

The package's CRAN website is https://cran.r-project.org/package=plm.

To install the development version from **GitHub**:

`install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")`

The development of package `plm` takes place on GitHub at https://github.com/ycroissant/plm
