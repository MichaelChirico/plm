# The `plm` package

`plm`, first posted on **CRAN** in 2006, is an **R** package for panel
data econometrics. It provides:

- enhanced data.frame to deal with data sets for which observations are identified by a combination of two indexes,
- a set of functions to estimate models (especially plm for linear panel models and pgmm for general method of moments estimators applied to panel data),
- a set of testing functions,
- a set of robust covariance matrix estimators.

To install the released version from **CRAN**:

`install.packages("plm")`

The package's CRAN website is: https://cran.r-project.org/package=plm

To install the development version from **RForge**:

`install.packages("plm", repos = 'http://R-Forge.R-project.org')`

The development of package `plm` currently takes place on R-Forge in a SVN repository: https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=406
However, in GitHub's `plm` repository, GitHub's issue tracker is used for the package (but nothing else, currently).
