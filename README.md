# The `plm` package

`plm`, first posted on **CRAN** in 2006, is an **R** package for panel
data econometrics. It provides:

- enhanced data.frame to deal with data sets for which observations are identified by a combination of two indexes,
- a set of functions to estimate models (especially plm for linear panel models and pgmm for general method of moments estimators applied to panel data),
- a set of testing functions,
- a set of robust covariance matrix estimators.

To install the released version on CRAN:

`install.packages("plm")`

To install the development version on **RForge**:

`install.packages("plm", repos = 'http://R-Forge.R-project.org'))`
